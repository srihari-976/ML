# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning model for predicting house prices based on various features. The goal of this project is to develop an accurate predictive model that can estimate the selling price of a house given its attributes.

## Overview

Predicting house prices is a common problem in real estate and finance industries. It involves analyzing various factors such as location, size, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, and amenities to determine a reasonable price for a property. Machine learning models offer a data-driven approach to this problem by learning patterns from historical housing data and using them to make predictions on new data.

In this project, we use a dataset containing information about houses (e.g., size, number of rooms, location) and their corresponding selling prices. We train a machine learning model on this dataset to predict the price of a house based on its features.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes a regression algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression) trained on a dataset of house attributes and prices to predict the selling price of a house.
- **Feature Engineering**: Performs feature engineering techniques such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to prepare the dataset for model training.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the performance of the machine learning model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tunes the model hyperparameters to improve its predictive performance and generalization ability.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizes the relationship between house features and prices using plots such as scatter plots, histograms, and correlation matrices.

## Usage

To use this project:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary Python dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. **Data Preparation**: Obtain a dataset containing information about houses and their selling prices. You can use publicly available housing datasets or collect your own data.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
4. **Model Training**: Train a machine learning regression model on the preprocessed dataset using a suitable algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression).
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model's performance using evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
6. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new house data to estimate their selling prices.
