# Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on various physicochemical properties. Leveraging machine learning techniques, we develop models to classify wine into different quality categories.

## Overview

Predicting wine quality is crucial for winemakers to maintain and improve the quality of their products. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze the physicochemical properties of wine samples and predict their quality ratings.

The dataset used in this project contains attributes such as acidity, pH, alcohol content, and other chemical properties, along with quality ratings provided by experts. By training machine learning models on this dataset, we can create predictive models that can accurately classify wine samples into different quality categories.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes classification algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines) to predict wine quality based on its physicochemical properties.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Performs data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical variables to prepare the dataset for model training.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the performance of the machine learning models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tunes the model hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search to optimize model performance.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Analyzes the importance of different features in predicting wine quality to gain insights into the factors that contribute most to wine quality.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizes the relationships between wine features and quality ratings using plots such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.
